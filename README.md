## Overview

This project is primarily for **educational** and **demonstrational** purposes. It pulls daily cryptocurrency prices (currently focused on BTC-USD) from Yahoo Finance, then uses a combination of **time series forecasting** and **heuristic-based signals** to generate trading suggestions.

**Key components** include:
1. **Chaotic Time Series Generation**: Maps a logistic map sequence to real price ranges to demonstrate chaotic behavior in financial markets
2. **ATR (Volatility) Filter**: Detects high volatility periods when predictions may be less reliable
3. **ARIMA Forecasting**: Uses `statsmodels` to predict future price movements
4. **Heuristic Trading Signals**: Combines volatility metrics, day-over-day changes, and forecasts to output "Buy," "Sell," or "Hold" recommendations

> **Note**: This is *not* financial advice or a production-ready trading bot. It illustrates fundamental concepts in quantitative finance and chaos theory.

## Features

- **Real-time Data Retrieval**: Download historical cryptocurrency data using `yfinance`
- **Volatility Analysis**: Calculate simplified Average True Range (ATR) to identify market conditions
- **Chaos Theory Application**: Generate synthetic price sequences using the logistic map
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Implement ARIMA modeling for short-term price prediction
- **Trading Signal Generation**: Produce actionable trading suggestions based on multiple factors

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-arima-forecast.git
cd crypto-arima-forecast

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- yfinance
- numpy
- pandas
- statsmodels
- matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

## Usage

Run the main script to generate forecasts and trading signals:

```bash
python crypto_prediction.py
```

To customize parameters such as the cryptocurrency, date range, or ARIMA model order, edit the constants at the top of the script.

## Methods

### Data Retrieval
The system pulls historical cryptocurrency data from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library, focusing on daily close prices.

### Chaotic Data Generation
A logistic map sequence is used to illustrate chaotic behavior in financial markets:

```
x_{i+1} = r * x_i * (1 - x_i)
```

Where:
- `r` is the control parameter (set to 3.9 for chaotic behavior)
- `x_0` is the initial condition

### Volatility Analysis
A simplified Average True Range (ATR) calculation identifies periods of high market volatility, which may impact prediction reliability.

### ARIMA Forecasting
The system uses an ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model to predict future price movements based on historical patterns.

### Trading Signal Logic
Trading signals are generated using:
1. ATR threshold as a volatility filter
2. Detection of significant day-over-day price changes
3. ARIMA forecast comparison with current prices

## Example Output

The system generates outputs similar to:

```
Historical Crypto Data (head):
              Open        High  ...     Volume  Adj Close
Date                            ...                      
2017-01-01  963.658081  963.658081  ...  8.382583  963.658081
...
